# Sorting
* -> reordering items that can be compared; e.g. integers, floating-point numbers, strings, ..
* -> of an array/list
* -> in a certain order - **increasing**, **non-decreasing (increasing or flat)**, **decreasing**, **non-increasing (decreasing or flat)**, **lexicographical**, ...

## Computer Science ideas:
* Comparison versus non-comparison based strategies,
* Iterative versus Recursive implementation,
* Divide-and-Conquer paradigm (e.g., Merge Sort or Quick Sort),
* Best/Worst/Average-case Time Complexity analysis,
* Randomized Algorithms, etc.
