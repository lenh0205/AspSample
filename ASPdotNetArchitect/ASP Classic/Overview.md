# ASP - Active Server Pages
* an old, deprecated `Microsoft Technology` for making **`dynamic Web pages`**
* It use **ASP file** (.asp) - the same as an **`HTML file`** but contain **`server scripts`** that's executed on the server

## Mechanism
* When a browser **`requests a normal HTML file`**, the server just returns the file
* When a browser **`requests an ASP file`** -> `server` passes the request to the **`ASP engine`** -> ASP engine reads the `ASP file` -> executes the **`server scripts`** in the file -> the `ASP file` is returned to the browser as **`plain HTML`**
