## ASP.NET MVC 5 
In Visual Studio, when you create a project using the ASP.NET Web Application template, it provides different sub-options, including MVC, Web Forms, Web API, and more. One of these options is ASP.NET MVC 5, which is a specific framework for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

Relationship Between an ASP.NET MVC 5 Project and an ASP.NET Web Application Project:
ASP.NET Web Application Template is a broader category

When you choose the ASP.NET Web Application template, it is a starting point that allows you to select a specific framework (e.g., MVC, Web API, Web Forms).
If you select MVC, then the generated project will be an ASP.NET MVC 5 project.
ASP.NET MVC 5 is a Specific Framework within the Web Application Template

If you choose the MVC option when creating an ASP.NET Web Application, it configures the project to use ASP.NET MVC 5.
This means the project structure includes:
Controllers (for handling requests)
Models (for data and business logic)
Views (for rendering UI)
RouteConfig.cs (for defining routes)
Startup configuration (like Global.asax in older versions)
web.config for settings.
Other Options Under the ASP.NET Web Application Template

If you choose Web Forms instead, you get an ASP.NET Web Forms project.
If you choose Empty, you get a minimal ASP.NET project, and you can manually add MVC or Web API later.
In Short:
ASP.NET Web Application is the template that lets you choose different frameworks.
ASP.NET MVC 5 is one of the frameworks you can select when creating a web application.
If you choose MVC while creating an ASP.NET Web Application, you get an ASP.NET MVC 5 project.


## ASP.NET Web API 2
If you choose ASP.NET Web Application as the template and then select Web API, the project will use ASP.NET Web API 2, which is different from ASP.NET MVC 5, though they share some similarities.

Key Differences:
ASP.NET Web API 2 is for building RESTful APIs

It is designed specifically for handling HTTP requests and responses (mostly JSON/XML).
It uses ApiController instead of Controller.
Routes are typically defined in WebApiConfig.cs using attribute routing or convention-based routing.
No Views folder since it's meant for APIs, not web pages.
ASP.NET MVC 5 is for web applications with UI

Uses Controller (not ApiController).
Works with Views (Razor pages) to generate HTML.
Uses RouteConfig.cs for defining routes.
Relationship Between ASP.NET MVC 5 and Web API 2
Both ASP.NET MVC 5 and ASP.NET Web API 2 are built on top of ASP.NET and use similar concepts.
They both support attribute routing, dependency injection, and middleware-like features.
You can combine both in the same project by adding Web API controllers to an MVC project.
What Technology is Used If You Choose Web API?
If you choose Web API in the ASP.NET Web Application template, your project will be built using:

ASP.NET Web API 2 (not ASP.NET MVC 5).
Owin/Katana (self-hosting option) if configured.
ASP.NET routing (WebApiConfig.cs).
JSON/XML serialization for API responses.
