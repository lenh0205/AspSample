# REST API
* -> **`REST (representational state transfer)`** is a software architectural style commonly used for building web services such as APIs
* -> an **`API (application programming interface)`** is a collection of functions and protocols that enables two software applications or systems to communicate with each other

===========================================================================
# REST API standards 
* _to **`make an API service RESTful`**, six guiding constraints must be satisfied:_

## Uniform interface

## Client-server architecture

## Statelessness

## Cacheability

## Layered system

## Code on demand (optional)
