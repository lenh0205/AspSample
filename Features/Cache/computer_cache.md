* Caching is a common technique to enhance system performance and reduce response time

* A typical system architecture involves several layers of caching
* At each layer, there are multiple strategies and mechanisms for caching data which depend on requirements and constrains of specific application

# Caching within computer  
* the most common hardware cache are L1, L2, L3 caches
* -> L1 cache is smallest and fastest cache, typically integrated into CPU
