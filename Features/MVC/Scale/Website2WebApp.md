# Website to Web Application
* -> in the early days of the web, most sites (_website_) were **simply collections of text and images**
* -> but as the web has evolved, more and more sites have begun to **`offer interactive features and functionality`**
* -> these function were once only found in **traditional desktop applications**

* => to decide between website and web app, it depend on **`specific goals and features`** we want our site/app to have
* => the main difference between them is that **`a website`** is **static** and **`a web application`** is **dynamic**

## website
* -> a **group of webpages** accessed through a web browser and are hosted on a web server 
* -> is usually **`made up of many individual files`** (_html_, css, ..._) that all work together to display the content on the screen

A website usually consists of information about a company or individual, such as contact information, products or services offered, and general information

## Web App
* -> is **a software application** that is **`hosted on a web server`** and **`accessed via a web browser`**
Web apps are usually written in a scripting language such as PHP, Perl or Java and use a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL to store data.

A web application, on the other hand, is interactive and allows users to perform tasks such as making purchases, viewing account balances, or playing games
