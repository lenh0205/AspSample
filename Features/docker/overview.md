# Reason using Docker
* -> giải quyết vấn đề "it works on my machine"
* -> đối với web developer thì nó tập trung vào fluid nature of managing and deploying applications
* -> using **Docker Container** to package an application with all its dependencies
* -> essential for microservices - run multiple services in isolation while facilitating communication between them
* -> scale app horizontally
* -> integrate with CI/CD
