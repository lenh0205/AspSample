* -> Module is a file that contains code to perform a specific task. A module may contain variables, functions, classes etc
* -> Using the module name we can access the function using the dot (.) operator

* -> A package is a container that contains various functions to perform specific tasks.
* -> In Python, we can import modules from packages using the dot (.) operator.
* -> The __init__.py used to define package-level attributes and operations, executed when the package or module is imported.
* -> In Python 3.3 and later versions, the __init__.py file is not required to define a package. If a directory contains modules but lacks an __init__.py file, it's still considered a package
