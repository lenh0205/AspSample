# License
* -> the license is **`a plain text XML file`** that contains details such as **the product name, number of developers it is licensed to, subscription expiry date and so on**
* -> the file is **`digitally signed`** - so **don't modify the file**; even inadvertent addition of an extra line break into the file will **invalidate it**

# Apply a License in 'Aspose' component
* -> we need to **set a license before utilizing Aspose.Cells** if we want to avoid its **`evaluation limitation`**
* -> it is only required to **set a license once per application (or process)**
* -> the license can be loaded from a **file**, **stream** or an **embedded resource**
