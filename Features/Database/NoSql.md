================================================================
# NoSql
* -> NoSQL databases are widely recognized for their **ease of development**, **functionality**, and **performance at scale**

## Flexibility
* -> _NoSQL databases_ generally **provide flexible schemas**  to **`store data`**
* -> that **enable faster and more iterative development**
* -> the flexible data model makes NoSQL databases ideal for **semi-structured** and **unstructured data**

## Scalability
* -> scale easily for **`building modern applications`**
* -> it's typically **designed to scale out by using distributed clusters of hardware**, as opposed to **`scaling up by adding expensive and robust servers`**
* _some cloud providers handle these operations behind the scenes as a fully managed service_

## High performance
* -> _NoSQL databases_ are **optimized for specific data models and access patterns**
* -> these **`enable higher performance`** than if we were trying to accomplish **`similar functionality with relational databases`**

## Highly functional
* -> _NoSQL databases_ provide **highly functional APIs and data types** that are **purpose-built** for **`each of their respective data models`**

================================================================
# Example
* -> **`applications process a large data volume from disparate sources`** like _social media, smart sensors, and third-party databases_
* -> all of this **`disparate data doesn't fit neatly into the relational model`**
* -> **`enforcing tabular structures`** can lead to **redundancy, data duplication, and performance issues at scale**

# Use Cases
* -> the range of NoSQL databases and their respective uses cases are **wide-ranging**
* -> like building **`high-performance mobile`**, **`Internet of Things (IoT)`**, **`gaming`**, and **`web applications that provide great user experiences at scale`**
* -> while it is challenging to present a representative set of use cases, below we provide a few illustrative examples as thought-starters:

## Real-time data management
* -> we can deliver **`real-time recommendations`**, **`personalization`**, and **`improved user experiences`** with NoSQL databases

```r - Ex:
// Disney+ delivers its "extensive digital content library" to "over 150 million+ subscribers" using NoSQL database technology
// it can scale and "deliver popular features" such as Continue Watching, Watchlist, and Personalized Recommendations with "Amazon DynamoDB"
```

## Cloud security
* -> we can use **graph databases** to **`quickly discover complex relationships within our data`**

```r - Ex:
// -> "Wiz" re-imagined cloud security as "a graph" using "Amazon Neptune"
// -> "Wiz" helps their customers improve their security posture by "quickly identifying" and "fixing the most critical risks"
// -> they use graph model stored in Amazon Neptune to "uncover the toxic combination of risk factors" that represent critical risks
// -> the Wiz risk engines "traverse the graph" and "within seconds, weave together a series of interconnected risks factors" in a security graph
```

## High-availability applications
* -> **`distributed NoSQL databases`** are excellent for **building high-availability, low-latency applications for messaging, social media, file sharing, and more**

```r - Ex:
// Snapchat has more than "290 million users sending billions of pictures and video messages daily"
// it uses NoSQL database systems to reduce the median latency of sending messages by 20%
