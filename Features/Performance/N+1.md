## The N+1 problem in Entity Framework (EF)
* -> occurs when querying a collection of entities along with their related data, leading to multiple database queries instead of a single optimized one. Here’s how you can avoid it:

## Use Eager Loading (Include)
Use the .Include() method to load related entities in a single query.

```cs
var orders = _context.Orders
    .Include(o => o.Customer)
    .Include(o => o.OrderItems)
    .ThenInclude(oi => oi.Product)
    .ToList();
```
This ensures that EF retrieves all related entities in one SQL query instead of multiple queries.

## Use Projection (Select)
Instead of loading entire entities, fetch only the necessary fields to optimize performance.

```cs
var orders = _context.Orders
    .Select(o => new 
    {
        o.Id,
        CustomerName = o.Customer.Name,
        OrderItems = o.OrderItems.Select(oi => new 
        {
            oi.Product.Name,
            oi.Quantity
        })
    })
    .ToList();
```

This avoids loading unnecessary columns and prevents EF from tracking unwanted entities.

## Use Explicit Loading for Large Data
If eager loading is too expensive, use explicit loading to fetch related entities when needed.

```cs
var order = _context.Orders.FirstOrDefault(o => o.Id == orderId);
_context.Entry(order).Collection(o => o.OrderItems).Load();
```

This avoids unnecessary joins and loads related data only when required.

## Use Batch Queries with AsSplitQuery (EF Core 5+)
EF Core 5+ introduced AsSplitQuery(), which improves performance when dealing with multiple one-to-many relationships.

```cs
var orders = _context.Orders
    .Include(o => o.Customer)
    .Include(o => o.OrderItems)
    .AsSplitQuery()
    .ToList();
```

This executes multiple queries efficiently instead of a single massive join, reducing data duplication.

## Use Lazy Loading (If Necessary) – But Be Cautious
Lazy loading loads related data only when accessed. However, it can lead to unexpected N+1 queries if not managed properly.
Enable Lazy Loading:

```cs
public class Order
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    
    public virtual Customer Customer { get; set; }  // Virtual enables lazy loading
}
```

Lazy loading works, but use it cautiously, as accessing a related entity inside a loop can trigger multiple queries.

## Use Raw SQL Queries (FromSqlInterpolated) for Performance-Critical Cases
For complex queries, use raw SQL to fetch only necessary data efficiently.

```cs
var orders = _context.Orders
    .FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerId = {customerId}")
    .ToList();
```

Use this only when needed to optimize query execution.

## Summary: Best Practices
✔ Use .Include() for eager loading when you need related data.
✔ Use .Select() to fetch only necessary fields.
✔ Use AsSplitQuery() for multiple one-to-many relationships.
✔ Avoid lazy loading unless explicitly required.
✔ Optimize performance with raw SQL when needed.
