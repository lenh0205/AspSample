# IdentityServer4
* -> is **`an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 framework for ASP.NET Core`**
* _as IdentityServer4 is **a framework, not a boxed product or a SaaS**; so we can customize it to adapt the system the way it makes sense for our scenarios_

## Basic Features

### Authentication as a Service 
* -> **centralized login logic and workflow for all of our applications (web, native, mobile, services)**
* -> IdentityServer is an officially certified **`implementation of OpenID Connect`**

### Single Sign-on / Sign-out
* -> single sign-on (and out) over **`multiple application types`**

### Access Control for APIs
* -> issue **access tokens** for APIs for **`various types of clients`**
* -> e.g. server to server, web applications, SPAs and native/mobile apps.

### Federation Gateway
* -> support for **`external identity providers`** like Azure Active Directory, Google, Facebook etc
* -> this shields our applications from the details of how to connect to these external providers
