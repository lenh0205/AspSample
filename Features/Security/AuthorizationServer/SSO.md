=======================================================================
# Single Sign On
* -> SSO is an **`authentication scheme`** - enables a user to **securely access multiple applications and services** using **`a single ID`**

### Example
* -> when **SSO is integrated into apps** like Gmail, Workday, or Slack; it **provides a pop-up widget or login page for the same set of credentials**
* -> with SSO, **users can access many apps without having to log in each time**

=======================================================================
# SSO and Federated Identity
* -> SSO is built on a concept called **`federated identity`** - enables **sharing of identity information across trusted but independent systems**
* -> _there are two **common protocols** for this authentication process:_

## SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
* -> an **`XML-based open standard`** for exchanging identity information between services
* -> it is commonly found in the **`work environment`**

## OpenID Connect
* -> **`when we use our personal account (e.g., Google) to sign into applications`** like YouTube
* -> it uses **`JSON Web Token`** to share **identity information** between services

# SSO Login Flow 

## Using SAML

### Step 1: Gmail Requests Authentication
* -> an office worker visits an application like Gmail; in SAML terms, Gmail in this example is a **Service Provider**
* -> the Gmail server detects that the user is from a work domain (e.g., @company.com), then returns a **`SAML Authentication Request`** (302 HTTP Redirect) back to the browser

### Step 2: Redirect to Identity Provider (IdP)
* -> the browser **`redirects the user to the Identity Provider`** (Okta, Auth0,...) for **the company specified in the SAML authentication request**
* -> the **`Identity Provider shows the login page`**, where the user enters the login credentials

### Step 3: User Authentication at the IdP
* -> once the user is authenticated, the **Identity Provider** generates a SAML response called a **`SAML assertion`** and returns that to the browser
* -> the "SAML assertion" is a **cryptographically-signed** XML document that contains **`information about the user`**, and **`what the user can access with the service provider`**

### Step 4: Returning the SAML Assertion to the Service Provider
* -> the **browser forwards the signed SAML assertion to the Service Provider**
* -> the **Service Provider validates that the assertion** was **`signed by the Identity Provider`** by (usually) using **`public key cryptography`**

### Step 5: Access Granted
* -> the Service Provider returns the **`protected resource`** to the browser based on what the user is allowed to access as specified in the SAML assertion
* -> this completes the walkthrough of a basic SSO login flow

# SSO for Multiple Applications
* -> letâ€™s see what happens when the user navigates to another SSO-integrated application, say, "Workday"
* -> the "Workday" server, as in the previous example with Gmail, detects the work domain and sends a SAML authentication request back to the browser.
* -> The browser again redirects the user to the Identity Provider.
* -> Since the user has already logged in with the Identity Provider, it skips the login process and instead, generates a SAML assertion for Workday, detailing what the user can access there.
* -> The SAML assertion is returned to the browser and forwarded to Workday.
* -> Workday validates the signed assertion and grants the user access accordingly.

# SSO with OpenID Connect
* -> the OpenID Connect flow is similar to SAML, but instead of passing signed XML documents, OpenID Connect passes around **`JWT`** - a signed JSON document
* -> the implementation details are a little bit different, but the overall concept is similar

=======================================================================
# Which SSO Method Should We Use?
* -> Both implementations are secure.
* -> For an enterprise environment where it is common to outsource identity management to a commercial identity platform, the good news is that many of these platforms provide strong support for both.
* -> The decision then depends on the application being integrated and which protocol is easier to integrate with.
* -> If we are writing a new web application, integrating with some of the more popular OpenID Connect platforms like Google, Facebook, and GitHub is probably a safe bet.
