* a **digital resource**
* -> is any **`combination of applications and data`** in a computer system
* -> _examples of digital resources_ include **`web applications`**, **`APIs`**, **`platforms`**, **`devices`**, or **`databases`** 

* **Identity** (_the core of IAM_)
* -> someone wants access to your resource, it could be _a customer, employee, member, participant,..._
* -> in IAM, a **user account** is a **`digital identity`**; _user accounts_ can also represent **`non-humans`**, such as software, Internet of Things devices, or robotics

* **Authentication**
* -> is the **`verification of a digital identity`**
* -> someone (or something) authenticates to **`prove that they're the user they claim to be`** 

* **Authorization**
* -> is the process of determining **`what resources a user can access`**  

# Authentication and Authorization
* _it’s common to confuse authentication and authorization because they **`seem like a single experience to users`**_
* -> they are two separate processes: **authentication** proves a **`user’s identity`**, while **authorization** grants or denies the **`user’s access to certain resources`**
