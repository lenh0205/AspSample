# Integrate IAM in Web Development
* -> IAM solution is a **`gatekeeper to the resources`** we provide **`to customers`** **`as web applications, APIs, ...`** 
* -> the gatekeeper initiates **`authorization`** as outlined in **OAuth 2.0**
* -> the addition of the **`OpenID Connect layer`** adds **authentication** to secure our usersâ€™ digital identities and our product

* _the Identity platform we choose_ 
* -> have to supports **`different application types and frameworks`**. Whether our application is a regular web app, a mobile app, or a machine-to-machine app
* -> supporting **`secure protocols`**
* -> allows us to **`customize login services`** to fit our business, our technology, and our customer base 
* -> connect our **`user data store`**, manage those users, choose an authorization grant, and establish authentication factors for a seamless, scalable product with an impactful user experience

## Authenticate
* -> the **`vehicle of authentication`** is the **login form**, or **`the intermediary`** to allow our users access to our application
* -> users provide **pre-determined credentials** (_such as username or password_), in the **`login form`** to verify their digital identities

### the "Login form" 
* -> **`Passwordless`** login with **`biometrics`**
* -> choice of **`multi-factor authentication methods`** from email, voice, or Duo
* -> **`Single Sign-on (SSO)`** capabilities
* -> **`Localization`** support

### Connect to "user" store
* -> _once we have a login form_, we can **`connect our user store to the Identity platform`**
* -> we can connect an **`existing database`**, or use a social, legal, or enterprise **`identity provider`** (_such as X or Azure Active Directory_)
* -> new users can sign up with the connection you have configured

### Set up Protocol
* -> _once we have a login form and user store connection_, we can set **`protocols that work behind the scenes`** when users log in to our application
* -> the **`most common protocols`** are associated with **the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) specs**
* -> **`another protocol`** to **`securely transmit information`** during log in comes in the form of **Tokens**
* -> **`Tokens`** from the **`Authorization Server`**, the Authentication API, transmit information between entities
* -> _When a user logs in and access is approved_, the Authentication API sends an **access token**, an **ID token**, or both depending on the authentication grant we are **`using to create a session`**
* -> **Access tokens** contain information about what **`scopes, or permissions, the requestor`** has in our application 
* -> while **ID tokens** have **`requestor information`** (_such as user metadata to better the user experience_)

* _Tokens from the Authentication API are **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** structured with:_
* -> a **`header`** that includes the signature
* -> the **`payload`** that contains statements and attributes about the requestor
* -> the **`signature`** that verifies the token is valid

* _other protocols, like **SAML** (Security Assertion Markup Language) and **WS-Fed** (Web Service Federation) are used with more specific systems_
* -> **`SAML`** works with **`some identity providers`** 
* -> **`WS-Fed`** is used with **`Microsoft products`**

## Manage users
* -> managing user profiles and access can be time-consuming
* -> we need easily automate CRUD operations and query user profiles using the Management API
* -> we're must able to categorize our users into categories to arrange our customer-base to fit our management style

### Levels of Access
* _our business model may include **levels of access** for our users_ 
* -> we may want **`a subsection of users to have read-only permissions`** and another **`subsection with the ability to edit`**
* -> the Identity platform allows you to implement **role-based access control**
* => we can **create roles**, **assign roles** to users, and **define permissions**

### Limit lifetime of Session
* _if you want to **`manage access`** based on **browser behaviors**, we can **limit the lifetime of a session**_
* -> **a session**, or the **`interaction`** between the **`requesting entity`** and **`our application or resource`**, has a lifetime limit 
* -> a session can end when the **`user closes the browser or navigates away from our webpage`**
* -> we can **`extend sessions`** with **refresh tokens** that renew access tokens

### Cookie
* -> Cookies, or strings of data, **tie into the session** and **represent an authenticated user**
* -> Cookies allow **`our authenticated users to maintain a session`** and **`move between web pages without being forced to re-authenticate`**
* -> once the browser closes, the **cookie is cleared by the browser**

##  Customize
* we may adjust the text of prompts our user receives when an action needs to be completed
* we can configure prompts for our users to signup, to enroll a device for authentication, or to send a code to an email/SMS for users to enter for verification
* we can also customize email communications to welcome new users, verify enrollment, or reset passwords with email templates
* we could add metadata before the user signs up or redirect users to an external site

## Secure
* -> alicious attacks can happen anytime; there're several **attack protection options** (_such as Bot Detection in combination with Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise to prevent cyber attacks_)
* -> some **security options** we can enable : **`Breached Password Detection`**,  **`Brute-Force Protection`**, **`Suspicious IP Throttling`** 

* **Breached password detection** - is a **`security measure against malicious agents with stolen credentials`**

* **Brute-force protection** 
* -> safeguards a targeted user account by **`limiting the amount of login attempts`**
* -> automatically **block the malicious IP** and **send a notification to the flagged user account**

* **suspicious IP throttling**
* -> works where **`brute force protection leaves off`** 
* -> to block traffic from any **`IP address`** that attempts **`rapid signups or logins`**

* _depend on how we want your users to authenticate_ 
* -> enabling **`multi-factor authentication (MFA)`** 
* -> can customize MFA to trigger under certain circumstances, such as a user logging in from an **`unknown device or from a questionable IP address`**
