# Web Testing
* -> is a software testing technique to test web applications, websites for **finding errors, bugs and also the quality-related risks**
* -> testing a web application is very common while testing any other application like **testing functionality, configuration, or compatibility, ....**

* -> Web testing should be continuous, especially after updates, new features, or major changes
* -> key **`metrics`** include **page load time, error rates, responsiveness, and cross-browser compatibility, security vulnerabilities**

* => IBM found that **the cost to fix an error found after product release was ... 100 times more than one identified in the maintenance phase**
* => 

## Types of Web Testing:
* _https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-web-based-testing/_
* -> Static Website Testing
* -> Dynamic Website Testing (CMS)
* -> E-Commerce Website Testing
* -> Mobile-Based Web Testing
 
## Approaches to Web Testing
* -> **`Manual testing`** - is when testers act as real users, navigating the website, and interacting with its features to identify bugs or usability problems.
* -> **`Automation testing`** - is when testers write an automation script, either by coding on an automation framework or leveraging automation testing tools, to perform the interactions for them

## STLC - Software Testing Life Cycle
1. Requirement Analysis
2. Test Planning
3. Test Case Developement
4. Enviroment Setup
5. Test Execution
6. Test Cycle Closure

* => nó có thể được được tổng hợp thành "Steps of Software Testing Process" (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/general-steps-of-software-testing-process/) như sau:
* -> Assess Development Plan and Status
* -> Develop the Test Plan
* -> Test Software Requirements
* -> Test Software Design
* -> Build Phase Testing
* -> Execute and Record Result
* -> Acceptance Test
* -> Report Test Results
* -> The Software Installation
* -> Test Software Changes
* -> Evaluate Test Effectiveness
