# Observer / Event-Subscriber / Listener
* -> lets us define a **subscription mechanism** to **`notify multiple objects`** about **`any events that happen to the object they're observing`**

## Problem
* -> the customer wastes time checking product availability
* -> the store wastes resources notifying by sending tons of spam emails to all customers each time a new product becomes available
